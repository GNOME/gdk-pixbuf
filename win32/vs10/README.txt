Note that all this is rather experimental.

Please do not build this package in a path that contains spaces to avoid
possible problems during the build or during the usage of the library.

Please refer to the following GNOME Live! page for more detailed
instructions on building GDK-Pixbuf and its dependencies with Visual C++:

https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/Win32/MSVCCompilationOfGTKStack

This VS10 solution and the projects it includes are intented to be used
in a GDK-Pixbuf source tree unpacked from a tarball. In a git checkout you
first need to use some Unix-like environment or manual work to expand
the .in files needed, mainly config.h.win32.in into config.h.win32.
You will also need to expand gdk-pixbuf.vcprojin here into
gdk-pixbuf.vcproj.

Two variants of the library are supported here for compilation-one
that makes use of native GDI+ APIs (The Debug/Release configurations)
and another that does not use GDI+ (those that use external third
party image manipulation libraries, the Debug_NoGDIP/Release_NoGDIP
configurations).  Note that both variants require LibPNG and ZLib, and
both variants have the image loaders built into the main GDK-Pixbuf library.

If one wants to build additional GDK-Pixbuf image loaders/modules that are
not included in the main GDK-Pixbuf library, such as the one included in
librsvg, he/she needs to place the compiled loader DLL (preferably built
with Visual C++ 2010) into the following location:
<parent_folder_of_the_GDK-Pixbuf_DLL>\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders\
and run the gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders utility to generate a loaders.cache
file in <parent_folder_of_the_GDK-Pixbuf_DLL>\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0.

The dependencies for this package are gettext-runtime (libintl), GLib*,
ZLib and LibPNG at the minimum.  Note that if you intend to build GDK-Pixbuf
that does not use GDI+, you will also need the IJG JPEG libraries, libTIFF and
libjasper (for JPEG-2000 operations).

Please note that the Visual Studio project files will typically link to the
latest stable release of LibPNG which the GDK-Pixbuf codebase supports by
default.  If you intend to use and link to an older version of LibPNG, you
may change the "Additional Dependencies" setting accordingly (such as changing
from libpng16.lib to libpng14.lib) for the GDK-Pixbuf project.  The minimum
supported release series for LibPNG is 1.0.x at this time of writing.

For the Dependencies, you may either:

a) look for all of the dependencies (except GLib*, libjasper) under

   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/dependencies/ (32-bit) -OR-
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win64/dependencies/ (64-bit)

   Please use the latest versions of these libraries that are available there,
   these are packaged by Tor Lillqvist, which are built with MinGW/GCC.
   Please see b) below regarding the build of libjasper and GLib*

   Note for LibPNG, version 1.5.x is needed.

-OR-

b) Build them yourself with VS10 (but you may most probably wish to get
   gettext-runtime from the URL(s) mentioned in a)).  Use the latest
   stable versions for them (you may need to get the latest unstable version of
   GLib if you are using an unstable version of GDK-Pixbuf):

   GLib*:   Grab the latest sources from http://www.gtk.org under "Download"
            (stable only-please make a search for the latest unstable versions)
   IJG JPEG: http://www.ijg.org/
   LibPNG: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html (1.5.x is needed here)
   LibTIFF: http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/
   LibJasper: http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/
   ZLib:   http://www.zlib.net

   The above 6 packages all have supported mechanisms (Makefiles and/or Project
   Files) for building under VS10 (upgrade the Project Files from earlier VS
   versions will do for these, when applicable).  It is recommended that ZLib
   is built using the win32/Makefile.msc makefile with VS10 with the ASM routines
   to avoid linking problems (copy zdll.lib to zlib1.lib[Release] or to zlib1d.lib
   [Debug] after completion of compilation)-see win32/Makefile.msc in ZLib for
   more details.

* This GLib refers to a build that is built by VS10

Set up the source tree as follows under some arbitrary top
folder <root>:

<root>\gdk-pixbuf\<this-gdk-pixbuf-source-tree>
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>

*this* file you are now reading is thus located at
<root>\gdk-pixbuf\<this-gdk-pixbuf-source-tree>\win32\vs10\README.

<PlatformName> is either Win32 or x64, as in the VS10 project files.

You should unpack the <dependent-package>-dev and <dependent-packge> (runtime)
into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>, if you download any of the packages from

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/dependencies/ (32-bit) -OR-
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win64/dependencies/ (64-bit)

so that for instance libintl.h end up at 
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include\libintl.h.

If you build any of the dependencies yourselves, copy the: 
-DLLs and EXEs into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\bin
-headers into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include\
-LIBs into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\lib

If you have not built GLib with VS10 and placed the LIBs and headers in a
place where VS10 can find them automatically, you should also uncompress
your GLib sources in <root>\ and build it from there, following the
instructions in <root>\glib<-version>\win32\vs10, so that the required
headers, EXEs, DLLs and LIBs will end up in
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include\glib-2.0 (headers)
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\lib (LIBs, also glib-2.0/include/glibconfig.h)
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\bin (EXEs/DLLs)
respectively.

After the build of GDK-Pixbuf, the "install" project will copy build results
and headers into their appropriate location under <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>.
For instance, built DLLs go into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\bin, built LIBs into
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\lib and GDK-Pixbuf headers into
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include\GDKPixbuf-2.0. This is then from where
project files higher in the stack are supposed to look for them, not
from a specific GDK-Pixbuf source tree.
