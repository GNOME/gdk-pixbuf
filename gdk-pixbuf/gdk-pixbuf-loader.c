 * SECTION:gdk-pixbuf-loader
 * @Short_description: Application-driven progressive image loading.
 * @Title: GdkPixbufLoader
 * @See_also: gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(), gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file()
 * 
 * #GdkPixbufLoader provides a way for applications to drive the
 * process of loading an image, by letting them send the image data
 * directly to the loader instead of having the loader read the data
 * from a file.  Applications can use this functionality instead of
 * gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() or gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file() 
 * when they need to parse image data in
 * small chunks.  For example, it should be used when reading an
 * image from a (potentially) slow network connection, or when
 * loading an extremely large file.
 * 
 * 
 * To use #GdkPixbufLoader to load an image, just create a new one, and
 * call gdk_pixbuf_loader_write() to send the data to it.  When done,
 * gdk_pixbuf_loader_close() should be called to end the stream and
 * finalize everything. The loader will emit three important signals
 * throughout the process. The first, #GdkPixbufLoader::size-prepared,
 * will be emitted as soon as the image has enough information to
 * determine the size of the image to be used. If you want to scale
 * the image while loading it, you can call gdk_pixbuf_loader_set_size()
 * in response to this signal.
 * 
 * 
 * The second signal, #GdkPixbufLoader::area-prepared, will be emitted as
 * soon as the pixbuf of the desired has been allocated. You can obtain it
 * by calling gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf(). If you want to use it, simply
 * ref it. You can also call gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf() later and get
 * the same pixbuf.
 * 
 * The last signal, #GdkPixbufLoader::area-updated, gets emitted every time
 * a region is updated. This way you can update a partially completed image.
 * Note that you do not know anything about the completeness of an image
 * from the updated area. For example, in an interlaced image, you need to
 * make several passes before the image is done loading.
 * 
 * # Loading an animation 
 *
 * Loading an animation is almost as easy as loading an image. Once the first
 * #GdkPixbufLoader::area-prepared signal has been emitted, you can call
 * gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_animation() to get the #GdkPixbufAnimation struct
 * and gdk_pixbuf_animation_get_iter() to get a #GdkPixbufAnimationIter for
 * displaying it.
